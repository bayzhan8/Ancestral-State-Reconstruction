## Navigation
In this work, we used the following simulated data:
* 8000 trees sampled from the posterior distribution by NestedBD 
* A ground truth tree 
* True copy numbers of 15500 genes 

Data Engineering.ipynb — In this notebook, I worked with the simulated data from NestedBD and formatted it as a CAFE5 input file (leaves_states.txt)

After that, I used the Tree Annotator function from the BEAST cross-platform program to make a summary Maximal  Clade Credibility (MCC) tree from the 8000 trees sampled from the posterior distribution generated by NestedBD 

Using the software for Computational Analysis of gene Family Evolution (CAFE5), I reconstructed the ancestral states of the cancerous cells.

Analysis.ipynb — In this notebook, I assessed the reconstruction method by comparing the CNAs of internal nodes of the ground truth tree and the reconstructed summary tree.

Tanglegram Vizualization.ipynb — In this notebook, I made a tanglegram as a visual aid for comparing the true tree witht the MCC tree

Reconstruct.py — a piece of code that reconstructes the ancestral states for each of the sampled 8000 trees and saves them in a "reconstructed" folder. This requires a lot of computaional power
